# Kailun Qin

Currently, I work at Intel in Shanghai, China, with a focus on software infrastructure for current- and next-gen Intel TEEs. In particular, I am one of the maintainers of the [Gramine project](https://github.com/gramineproject) -- a lightweight Library OS/unikernel (with SGX and TDX backends) for confidential computing.

Meanwhile, I am earning my DEng degree part-time at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), as part of the Lab of Cryptology and Computer Security (LoCCS), under the supervision of Prof. Dawu Gu. My research centers on confidential computing, while my interests also extend to system software, system security, and cloud security.

From 2019 to 2020, I worked at Ant Group, and from 2017 to 2019, I was with Intel. Prior to joining Intel as a Recent College Graduate (RCG) in 2017, I interned at NXP Semiconductors (2015-2016) and STMicroelectronics (Le Mans, France, 2015) during my master's studies at IMT Atlantique (Nantes, France) and Nanjing University of Science and Technology (China).
